This is the guide for hosting collaborative online testing on your own computer.

Requirements: 
1. You must have "Node.js" on your computer. if you are using Windows, downloading "Node.js" will also give you the "Node.js commend prompt.
2. You must have your own document-oriented database. We suggest to use MongoDB, and you will need the connection string of your database.
		If you are MongoDB, you can find your connection URL by:
			1. Sign in your MongoDB account.
			2. Creating your Clusters.
			2. Clicking "connect" under the name of your Cluster (this button is in the mid left followed by metrics and collections), then select "Connect your application".
			3. Setting "DRIVER"="Node.js", "VERSION"="2.0.14 or later".
			4. Copy the connection string and change the "<password>" to your account password.

You need to update the `dbUrl` variable to your database connection in **index.js**.

Note: You don't need add your own data or load a sample database, the project will initialize an account for you.
The default teachers' account is "123", password "admin".

Running:
1. Go to the directory of this project in cmd.
2. If this is the first running, type `npm install`.
3. Type `node index.js` to localhost, the default link will be `localhost:8888`.


To create questions:
you need to update the json in `data/questions.json` in line 25, you need to define a unique string id for the question set id.
`name` is the displayed name of the question set id, this can be different from the unique string id.
`numOfQuestions` is the total number of questions each set has.
`isHidden` is a boolean value to determine whether we should display it in the page.
`questions` is an array of questions.
Each question will have `type` : 'singleChoice' | 'multipleChoice' | 'openQuestion',
`title`, `text`, `image`, `option`.
If the question set is collaborative, each question will also have `maxHintAllowedPerPerson`, `versionA`, `verionsB`, `hint` and `hintText`.

If you want add images: save your images to `../webapp/template/questions/asset`.


To access database:
Go to `https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/clusters`.
email:uywang@ucdavis.edu
password:QE-49af78cHij-10

Then you can see the database by clicking `connections`.
